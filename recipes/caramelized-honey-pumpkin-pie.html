<h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <p><ul>
    <li>Flaky All-Butter Pie Dough parbaked in a 9-inch pie plate and cooled</li>
    <li>5 tbs unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (4 oz) Honey*</li>
    <li>3/4 cup heavy cream at room temperature</li>
    <li>4 large eggs at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 can unsweetened pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)**</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground allspice</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp ground cloves***</li>
    <li>softly whipped cream for serving</li>
  </ul></p>

<p><h3>Assembly Steps</h3></p>

  <p><h4><u>Step 1</u></h4></p>

  <p><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat 
    the oven to 325°F. Place the parbaked pie crust on a foil-lined rimmed baking 
    sheet and set aside.</p>

    <p><h4><u>Step 2</u></h4></p>

    <p><strong>Brown the butter:</strong> In a small saucepan, cook the butter over medium-low 
        heat, stirring and scraping the bottom and sides constantly with a heatproof spatula. 
        The mixture will sputter as the water boils off. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping, 
        until the sputtering subsides, the butter is foaming, and the solid bits turn a 
        dark brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>

    <p><h4><u>Step 3</u></h4></p>
    
    <p><strong>Caramelize the honey:</strong> Remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately 
        add the honey (to prevent the butter from burning), stirring to combine. Return the 
        saucepan to medium heat and bring to a boil. Continue to cook, swirling often, until the
         mixture is darkened slightly and has a savory, nutty smell, about 2 minutes. Remove the 
         saucepan from the heat and slowly stream in the heavy cream, stirring constantly 
         (be careful—the mixture may sputter) until it’s smooth. Set the warm honey mixture 
         aside.</p>

    <p><h4><u>Step 4</u></h4></p>
    
    <p><strong>Make the pumpkin filling:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk the eggs to break up
         the whites and yolks, then add the brown sugar and whisk vigorously until the mixture
          has lightened in color by a shade or two, about 1 minute. Whisk in the pumpkin, 
          cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, salt, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves until smooth. Slowly 
          stream in the warm honey mixture, whisking constantly, until the filling is completely 
          homogenous.</p>

    <p><h4><u>Step 5</u></h4></p>
    
    <p><strong>Fill the crust and bake:</strong> Pour the filling into the parbaked crust all
         the way to the top. (Depending on the height of your crust, you may have some leftover 
         filling, which I recommend you keep!) **** Ever so carefully transfer the pie to the 
         center rack and bake until the filling is set and puffed around the edges and the center
          wobbles gently, 45 to 60 minutes.</p>

    <p><h4><u>Step 6</u></h4></p>
    
    <p><strong>Cool the pie gently:</strong> Turn off the oven and prop the door open with a 
        wooden spoon. Let the pie cool completely in the oven. Doing so will allow it to cool 
        gradually, which will prevent cracking on the surface.</p>

    <p><h4><u>Step 7</u></h4></p>
    
    <p><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice the pie into wedges and top each piece with softly whipped
         cream. Grate a bit of fresh nutmeg over the cream and serve.</p>  

        <p>*Use a good-quality, dark-hued honey. The more strongly flavored the better, 
            so it stands out against the pumpkin. Just don’t use buckwheat or chestnut honey, 
            which are too intense.</p>
        
        <p>**I don’t bother making my own puree from fresh pumpkin since I’ve never 
            found it worth the effort. Canned pumpkin like Libby’s is lower in moisture and 
            produces a perfectly smooth, flavorful pie.</p>
        
        <p>***I like this combination of warm spices, but if you are missing one, can’t find 
            them all at the store, or just don’t like certain spices, feel free to come up with 
            your own blend.</p>
        
        <p>****Bake any remaining pumpkin filling separately in a small ramekin. I like to do 
            this to prevent ingredient waste, and also because it allows me to sample the filling 
            prior to cutting into the pie!</p>
